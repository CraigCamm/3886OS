# Search for the masses

Search is the touchstone of the Internet; without it, the Internet wouldn’t be all that useful. But search hasn’t always been that easy nor affordable to implement. That's where Elasticsearch shines. Elasticsearch adds not only a simple API for adding and searching content, but does it in a distributed manner. With infinitesimal arm grease, you can set up a search cluster that smears your data and resultant queries across a series of nodes. Not only is this resultant architecture fast, but it’s easy to set up and extremely affordable as search nodes can run on commodity hardware. 

Using this repository, I'll show you how to get up and running with Elasticsearch. You'll learn how to create a cluster, how to index and search documents via its RESTful API and how to use a few handy client libraries. You'll be bringing search to the masses in no time!
